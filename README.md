# DevSoc 2026 Subcommittee Recruitment Technical Assessment

Hiya!
Thank you for applying to DevSoc project teams for 2026. Our projects are proudly maintained by student society volunteers like yourself who for many years have ideated, built and iterated the websites within our portfolios.

To complete this assessment, you will need to [fork and clone this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository), implement and push your solutions to GitHub, and submit a link to your fork in the application form.

Note that this repository contains all questions for our technical screening and you are **NOT** required to attempt all questions!

See each of the subdirectories (`backend`, `frontend`, `chaos`, `freerooms`, `platforms`) for the relevant assessments. Please **carefully** read the submission instructions - if we are unable to access your solutions, we cannot consider them in the recruitment process.

## Assessment Task Instructions
Each project requires different sections of this assessment to be completed. Below is a summary of these requirements, to guide you. For more info, please read the respective folder's README file. If the instructions and requirements on this page are different to that README, the requirements on that README will prevail.

### General Projects Assessment
You should complete either the [backend](./backend/README.md) **OR** [frontend](./frontend/README.md) tasks if you are applying to the following ports:
* Circles
* Notangles
* Structs

### Chaos
If you are applying for **Chaos**, you should complete either the [chaos](./chaos/README.md) **AND** [backend](./backend/README.md) tasks for backend, **OR** the [frontend](./frontend/README.md) task.
